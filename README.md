# Unit 2 - Store Management Project

## Introduction

You are opening a new business in your community! Businesses often need programs to manage the products and services they offer and track orders and requests from customers. Your goal is to create a store management system for your business.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming and class structure and design to create your store management system:
- **Create a class hierarchy** – Develop a superclass that represents a product or service your business offers and one or more subclasses that extend the superclass to represent more specific types of products or services.
- **Declare instance variables** – Declare instance variables in the superclass that are shared with the subclasses and instance variables in the subclasses that are not shared with the superclass.
- **Write constructors** – Write no-argument and parameterized constructors in the superclass and subclasses. Subclass constructors use the super keyword to call the superclass constructor.
- **Implement accessor and mutator methods** – Write accessor and mutator methods for instance variables that should be accessible and/or modifiable from outside of the class.
- **Implement a toString() method** – Write toString() methods in the superclass and subclasses that return information about the state of an object.

## Description

In my Store Management Project, I made the Makeover store. I chose this store because I love doing my makeup, my hair, and watching videos about makeup and hair for fun. When I was little, I wanted to be either a big makeup artist or hairstylist for famous people, so I can travel the world while doing the hobbies I enjoy. In my  project, I have my StoreRunner, Makeover superclass, and my two subcasses, MakeupStylist and HairStylist. In the Makeover superclass, I have my 3 'basic' instance variables, price, service, and stylist, which is what will be displayed once ran. I also have no-argument constructors, parameterized constructors, accessor and mutator methods, and toString methods in the three classes, Makeover, MakeupStylist, and Hairstylist. My no-argument constructors are the default constructor of the class. My parameterized constructors initialize the values I defined/assigned. My accessor methods return the value I assigned or defined. My mutator methods reset or changes what I assigned. Finally, my toString methods create a sort of "list" for the values or variables I created, and they help me put together sentences or the output once the user presses run. My project's output tells you the service, price, and stylist you're recieving.
